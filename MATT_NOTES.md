Things to read and try:
1. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/marker-remove
2. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/polyline-complex
3. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/drawing-tools

https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/polyline-complex is the plain JS way.  This is easier.
